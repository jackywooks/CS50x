# CS50x

CS50x through edX Progress
This is my journey to finish the CS50

<h2> Week 0 Problem Set - Scratch </h2>
<h3> Sratch - <a href="https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/1040835710/">Penalty ShootOut Game</a> </h3>
<h4> Instruction <a href="https://github.com/jackywooks/CS50x-2024/tree/main/Week0%20-%20Scratch"> Code </a> </h4>
The player will use arrow keys to control the direction of the ball, press: <br>
↑ to shoot the ball in the middle. <br>
→ to shoot the ball to the right.  <br>
← to shoot the ball to the left.   <br>
And press space to shoot the ball. <br>
The goalkeeper will guess your direction to save the ball. If either the player scored 5 goals, or the goalkeeper made five saves, the game will end.

<h2> Week 1 Problem Set - Introduction to C</h2>
<h3> <a href= "https://github.com/jackywooks/CS50x-2024/tree/main/Week1%20-%20C/me"> Hello, Me</a> </h3>
<p> Pretty Easy </p>
<h3> <a href="https://github.com/jackywooks/CS50x-2024/tree/main/Week1%20-%20C/mario-more"> Mario (More)</a> </h3>
<p> Pretty Easy - get myself familairze with the loop and basics in C </p>
<h3> <a href="https://github.com/jackywooks/CS50x-2024/tree/main/Week1%20-%20C/credit"> Credit </a> </h3>
<p> Interesting Program to get me know how to idenitfy credit card issuer and implement the logic to validate checkSum of credit card </p>

<h2> Week 2 Problem Set - Arrays </h2>
<h3> <a href= "https://github.com/jackywooks/CS50x-2024/tree/main/Week2%20-%20C%20Array/scrabble"> Scrabble </a> </h3>
<p> Easy Task to store the points of alphabet in Scrabble in an array and use it to calculate the score of words for 2 players </p>
<h3> <a href="https://github.com/jackywooks/CS50x-2024/tree/main/Week2%20-%20C%20Array/readability"> Readability </a> </h3>
<p> Utilizing Coleman-Liau index, I wrote a program to detect the reading levels of the passage provided</p>
<h3> <a href="https://github.com/jackywooks/CS50x-2024/tree/main/Week2%20-%20C%20Array/substitution"> Substitution </a> </h3>
<p> Using a 26-character pre-define key to encrypt text, basically, it replace the alphabet of the plaintext with the character in the key </p>

<h2> Week 3 Problem Set - Algorithms</h2>
<h3> <a href= "https://github.com/jackywooks/CS50x-2024/tree/main/Week3%20-%20Algorithm/Algorithm">Sorting Algorithms</a> </h3>
<p> I implement the sorting algorithms in C for practise </p>
<h3> <a href="https://github.com/jackywooks/CS50x-2024/tree/main/Week3%20-%20Algorithm/plurality"> Plurality </a> </h3>
<p> Complete a program for the first past the post voting system </p>
<h3> <a href="https://github.com/jackywooks/CS50x-2024/tree/main/Week3%20-%20Algorithm/tideman"> Tideman </a> </h3>
<p> This is acutally one of the biggest challenge in this CS50 course since the beginning. In this program, I will firstly need to store the preference between candidate. Store the winner and loser in a pair array. Sort the pair array by the preference power, i.e. votes margin. I use merge Sort here. And then locked the pair to prevent creating cycles in the graph. And finally print the winner </p>
<p> Thanks to CS50 that they break down the problem into small and managerable pieces or else it would be very hard for a beginner to code it.</p>

<h2> Week 4 Problem Set - Memory</h2>
<h3> <a href= "https://github.com/jackywooks/CS50x-2024/tree/main/Week4%20-%20Memory/volume"> Volume </a> </h3>
<p> Introduction of pointer this week, we are now handling WAV file to read the WAV file, copy its header and then output the audio with multipcation of the input factor.</p>
<h3> <a href="https://github.com/jackywooks/CS50x-2024/tree/main/Week4%20-%20Memory/filter-more">Filter (More)</a> </h3>
<p> Another Challenge to handle filter in .bmp file. A .bmp file also has headers and content store afte the header. In this problem set, we will need to add filter to the picture by manipulating the content of the image (content after header). To grayscale, blur or make a reflection to an image is not hard at all. But detecting edges is harder and we will need to use the Sobel Operator. It is amazing that I can use C to create filter on image. </p>
<h3> <a href="https://github.com/jackywooks/CS50x-2024/tree/main/Week4%20-%20Memory/recover">Recover</a> </h3>
<p> A smaller functino compared to the filter. It is very interesting that I can now recover jpeg file even if it is deleted. </p>
